Unit 0: Foundations | Final Practice: Dream Application
In this Repo, I will add a concept of my app idea. 
This will go through the modules we have learned in Unit 0 and add at least one example of code.



Write a brief description of the application you are imagining. It should walk though who the application is for, what it does, and a few features the user would interact with.

My application is for everyday home cooks who need some extra help when it comes to using the ingredients they have at home while also having the ability to create a list of the ingredients they might be missing! The app will feature a input list of what ingredients the user currently has and then they can add a recipe they want or they could pick a suggested recipe from the current ingredients. This will help with weekly meal prep and takes out the thinking process for groceries and deciding what to cook!

2. For each module of the course, write a 1-2 sentence description of how you could use that knowledge to build an application. You should include at least one skill from all of the following:

â—‹ Organization and Time Management
For organization and time management I will be using the pomodoro technique which will help me achieve my current app goals by breaking down my workload. Working through difficult assignments in one go can cause stress and procrastination, by organizing my tasks in smaller projects and allowing breaks this will allow a healthy work flow in the creation of the app.

â—‹ Values, Data Types, and Operations
For Values, Data Type and Operations I will use arrays to store ingredients and Booleans to check if each ingredient for a recipe is available. I will also use string values to represent the ingredient names and combined arrays using .push() and the spread operator.

â—‹ The Growth Mindset 
In Growth Mindset when something doesn't work right away like merging arrays correctly or handling nested arrays. I will keep testing, learning, and improving my code without giving up. I see errors as part of the learning process. This is how we achieve a growth mindset in our lives every day and at work!

â—‹ Stringing Characters Together
In Stringing Characters Together I will use string concatenation to build output messages like "Taco Recipe: " + tacoRecipe, and add a Unicode emoji to make the output more fun and user-friendly. For example (\u{1F32E} stands for ðŸŒ®). This adds a modern look to the application and keep the audience more engaged! 

â—‹ Control Structures and Logic
In Control Structures and Logic I plan to use if...else logic to check if all required ingredients are present using Booleans, and give the user feedback depending on whether they could make the recipe or not. A feature like this is important because it opens the door for possible AI integrations in the future, helping suggest recipes based on user ingredients and preferences.

â—‹ Working with Loops
In Working with Loops I will use forEach loops to combine ingredient lists and move items from one array to another. This will let me go through each item and add it to a new array automatically. This saves both code length and coding time in the future when coding long lists! 

â—‹ Building Arrays
In Building Arrays I will be using them for the foundation of the application! I will be using Arrays to store home ingredients, purchases and suggestions for the recipe. This will eventually create a working system for tracking what the user can make or what ingredients they need to buy.
